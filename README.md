# Tiktok User Engagement project

Intro: 
The data team is working towards building a machine learning model that can be used to determine whether a video contains a claim or whether it offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently. The team is getting closer to completing the project, having completed an initial plan of action, initial Python coding work, EDA, and hypothesis testing.

The TikTok team has reviewed the results of the hypothesis testing. TikTokâ€™s Operations Lead, Maika Abadi, is interested in how different variables are associated with whether a user is verified. Earlier, the data team observed that if a user is verified, they are much more likely to post opinions. Now, the data team has decided to explore how to predict verified status to help them understand how video characteristics relate to verified users. Therefore, you have been asked to conduct a logistic regression using verified status as the outcome variable. The results may be used to inform the final model related to predicting whether a video is a claim vs an opinion.

Result:
1. The dataset has a few strongly correlated variables, which might lead to multicollinearity issues when fitting a logistic regression model. We decided to drop video_like_count from the model building.
2. Based on the logistic regression model, each additional second of the video is associated with 0.009 (8.607893e-03) increase in the log-odds of the user having a verified status.
3. The logistic regression model had not great, but acceptable predictive power: a precision of 61% is less than ideal, but a recall of 84% is very good. Overall accuracy is towards the lower end of what would typically be considered acceptable.
